        ### Why is modern web development so complicated?

        **There are more choices in tech than ever**, and with it comes more questions and more complexity.

        Have you ever thought:

        * "Why do I have to write **so much boilerplate**?"
        * "How do **so many bugs make it to production**?"
        * "Why is my app **so slow**!?"
        * "Why do I have to choose between fast prototyping and long term maintainability?"

        Every performance issue and every bug steals precious time from making your service better.

        ### What if you could get something up quickly *and* maintain it for years to come?

        Imagine this:

        * Generators for quick code creation
        * Built in authentication (Optional)
        * Secure by default
        * Built in Webpack config to get a SPA off the ground fast (Optional)
        * Insanely fast execution so users arenâ€™t left waiting
        * Powerful type system that helps catch bugs before they ever hit production
